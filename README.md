Rollercoaster Ticketing System
Welcome to the Rollercoaster Ticketing System! This program helps determine if you are eligible to ride a rollercoaster based on your height, and calculates the ticket price based on your age.

Features
Height Check: Ensures the rider meets the minimum height requirement of 120 cm.
Age-based Pricing: Calculates the ticket price depending on the rider's age:
Children (under 12): $5
Teens (12-18): $7
Adults (18 and above): $12
User-friendly: Simple prompts guide the user through entering their height and age.
How It Works
The program asks for your height in centimeters.
If you meet the minimum height requirement (120 cm), the program proceeds to ask for your age.
Based on your age, the program calculates and displays your ticket price.
If you don't meet the height requirement, the program will inform you that you're not tall enough to ride.
